# hello-world
Use hello-world exercise to learn about GitHub capabilities. I am new to GitHub so it seems important
that I learn how to use this service properly. Overall, I hope to continue to improve my coding skills,
mostly focused on quantitative analysis of time series data - and expand my knowledge of coding languages 
relevant to data science / quant analysis.
